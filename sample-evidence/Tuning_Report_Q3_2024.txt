EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
============================================

This report documents the quarterly tuning review conducted for the Bank's transaction monitoring system covering the period July 1 - September 30, 2024.

Key Findings:
- 3 scenarios adjusted for improved detection
- False positive rate reduced by 12% from prior quarter
- 2 new scenarios recommended for Q4 implementation
- Overall system performance meets regulatory expectations

============================================
ALERT VOLUME ANALYSIS
============================================

Monthly Alert Generation:
- July 2024: 1,187 alerts
- August 2024: 1,245 alerts
- September 2024: 1,198 alerts
- Q3 Average: 1,210 alerts/month

Alert Disposition:
- Closed - No Suspicious Activity: 942 (78%)
- Closed - SAR Filed: 47 (4%)
- Closed - Enhanced Monitoring: 156 (13%)
- Pending Investigation: 65 (5%)

============================================
SCENARIO PERFORMANCE
============================================

Scenario: Large Cash Transactions
- Previous Threshold: $8,000
- Alert Volume: 287/month
- SAR Conversion Rate: 2.1%
- RECOMMENDATION: Lower threshold to $7,500
- Rationale: Recent guidance emphasizes structuring detection below $10,000

Scenario: Wire Transfer Velocity  
- Previous Threshold: 5 wires per day
- Alert Volume: 145/month
- SAR Conversion Rate: 4.8%
- RECOMMENDATION: Adjust to 4 wires per day
- Rationale: Peer benchmarking indicates tighter controls

Scenario: Rapid Movement of Funds
- Previous Threshold: 80% of deposits moved within 48 hours
- Alert Volume: 203/month
- SAR Conversion Rate: 6.2%
- RECOMMENDATION: No change - performing well

Scenario: ACH Structuring Detection
- Previous Configuration: Basic pattern matching
- Alert Volume: 178/month
- SAR Conversion Rate: 1.8%
- RECOMMENDATION: Enhance pattern detection algorithm
- Rationale: Below-target SAR conversion indicates missed activity

============================================
THRESHOLD ADJUSTMENTS IMPLEMENTED
============================================

Change #1: Large Cash Scenario
- Effective Date: October 1, 2024
- Previous: $8,000
- New: $7,500

- Approval: BSA Officer, September 25, 2024

Change #2: Wire Transfer Velocity
- Effective Date: October 1, 2024

- New: 4 per day
- Expected Impact: +20% alert volume
- Approval: BSA Officer, September 25, 2024

Change #3: ACH Pattern Detection
- Effective Date: October 15, 2024
- Enhancement: Added 3-day rolling pattern analysis
- Expected Impact: +10% alert volume, improved detection
- Approval: BSA Officer, September 28, 2024

============================================
FALSE POSITIVE ANALYSIS
============================================

Q3 2024 False Positive Rate: 78%
Q2 2024 False Positive Rate: 82%
Improvement: 12% reduction

Contributing Factors:
- Refined customer segmentation
- Improved baseline calculations
- Removal of redundant scenarios

============================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR Q4 2024
============================================

1. Implement cryptocurrency-related scenario
   - Risk assessment indicates growing exposure
   - Vendor has available scenario package

2. Add peer-to-peer payment monitoring
   - Zelle and similar services increasing
   - Current scenarios do not adequately cover

3. Continue monitoring adjusted thresholds
   - Validate expected alert volume increases
   - Assess SAR conversion rate impacts
